# Project Overview:
This Flutter TODO application is a clean, scalable, and production-ready task manager built using BLoC for state management, following the Clean Architecture pattern, and strictly adhering to SOLID principles. The app communicates with a remote server through a RESTful API to perform full CRUD operationsâ€”including Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PATCH), and Delete (DELETE)â€”providing a seamless and efficient task management experience. With a well-organized, modular structure dividing responsibilities into Data, Domain, and Presentation layers, the codebase is easy to maintain, extend, and test. The user interface is designed using custom widgets for a smooth, responsive, and intuitive experience. This project is a great reference for developers aiming to implement best practices in real-world Flutter applications.
